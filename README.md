## Overview

Flexible Software Package (FSP) for Renesas RZ/T series.

FSP is the next generation Arm® MCU software package from Renesas, that enables secure devices and IoT connectivity through production ready peripheral drivers, FreeRTOS, and portable middleware stacks.
FSP includes best-in-class HAL drivers with high performance and low memory footprint. Middleware stacks with FreeRTOS integration are included to ease implementation of complex modules like communication and security.
